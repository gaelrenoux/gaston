- Add unit test for forced topics
- When a schedule is a success (better than previous one), try to re-assign everyone a few times to see if you can improve it further
- Count not the increasing-scores chedules in the logs, but all tested schedules
- Better handling of constraints
- Incompatibility reward should be in the preference (in the config), not in settings
- Test that keeping the same seed keeps the same results (doesn't seem to be working)
