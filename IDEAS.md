- Add unit test for forced topics
- When a schedule is a success (better than previous one), try to re-assign everyone a few times to see if you can improve it further
- Count not the increasing-scores chedules in the logs, but all tested schedules
- Better handling of constraints
- Incompatibility reward should be in the preference (in the config), not in settings
- Test that keeping the same seed keeps the same results (doesn't seem to be working)
- Nothing and Unassigned should be merged when there's no minimum on the acceptable number of persons unassigned. Better conf would be a min number, with different anti-preferences above and below that min.
- Create a max-unassigned or max-nothing, and use a topic-exclusive ? It's not a personal pref though, so it doesn't work that well
