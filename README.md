# Gaston

Gaston is a tool to build schedules for conventions and such. It was build for RPG conventions.

It works by generating schedules and adjusting them, trying to get the best possible global score. The global score is a
function giving more importance to people with a low score (ensuring the end schedule is fair, not sacrificing
completely a person's satisfaction so that other can have a great schedule).



## Running Gaston

Clone the repository, and build with: `sbt assembly`

This produces a fat jar in target/scala-2.12, which you can then run with:
```
java -jar target/scala-2.12/gaston-assembly-0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar --from problem.conf
```

To get the full list of command line options, use:
```
java -jar target/scala-2.12/gaston-assembly-0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar --help
```



## Input file

The input file describes the problem to solve. It follows the HOCON format, and should be in UTF-8. To give you an idea the values of the scores, each person has 1000 points distributed over their wishes.

- `gaston`: Root element of the configuration.
    - `settings`: Global settings. All fields are optional and have a default value.
        - `incompatibility-anti-preference`: Negative score for a person forced to share a topic with someone it would rather not. Default is `-1000`.
        - `default-max-topics-per-slot`: Max number of topics per slot (default is no limit.
        - `default-min-persons-per-topic`: Minimum number of persons per topic, can be overriden on specific topics. Default is `1`.
        - `default-max-persons-per-topic`: Maximum number of persons per topic, can be overriden on specific topics. Default is `10`.
        - `max-persons-on-nothing`: On each slot, maximum number of persons who can have no topic scheduled. Default value is `0`, i.e. everyone must have a topic scheduled on each slot.
        - `min-persons-on-nothing`: On each slot, minimum number of persons who can have no topic scheduled (the idea being that enough unoccupied persons can do something together). Default is `0`, i.e. no minimum.
        - `person-on-nothing-anti-preference`: Negative score attached to a person doing nothing on a slot. Default value is `-100`.
        - `backtrack-initial-schedule`: Technical stuff: should initial schedules be empty or backtracked ? Best answer depends on the schedule being highly constrained or note. Default is `true`.
    - `tableSettings`: Settings for importing a table. Optional (leave that field out if you are not importing a table). See the *Importing a table* section below for details. 
    - `slots`: The slots on which to schedule, as an array of arrays of slots. The inner arrays contain the slots following each other directly (such as one in the morning and the other in the afternoon of the same day), so that mult-slot topics may be handled (WIP). The following lines describe the structure of one slot.
        - `name`: Name of the slot. Must be unique among slots.
        - `max-topics`: Maximum number of topics to schedule on this slot (e.g. because space as limited at that time).
    - `topics`: The topics to schedule. The following lines describe the structure of one topic.
        - `name`: Name of the topic. Must be unique among topics.
        - `min`: Minimum number of persons on a topic. Default is empty (will use the settings' value).
        - `max`: Maximum number of persons on a topic. Default is empty (will use the settings' value).
        - `occurrences`: How many sessions of the topic are possible. Default is `1`.
        - `slots`: An array of slot names on which the topic can be scheduled. Default is empty (can be scheduled on any slot).
        - `presence`: A score added for just having this topic present. Can be used to favor a topic, or to set a topic as to avoid if possible (with a negative score). Default is `0`.
        - `forced`: If `true`, this topic *must* be scheduled. Default is `false`.
    - `persons`: The persons to schedule. The following lines describe the structure of one person.
        - `name`: Name of the person. Must be unique among persons.
        - `weight`: A person with a higher weight counts more when calculating the global score. Specifically, that person's individual score will be divided by its weight, bringing them down and making the schedule optimizing more for them. Default is `1`.
        - `base-score`: You can add a starting value for this person's score. This is useful only in very specific situations. Default is `0`.
        - `absences`: An array of slot names on which this person is missing, and therefore cannot be scheduled. Default is empty.
        - `mandatory`: An array of topic names for which this person is mandatory: it must be present on those topics. Default is empty.
        - `forbidden`: An array of topic names for which this person is forbidden: it cannot be scheduled on those topics. Default is empty.
        - `incompatible`: An array of person names this person wish not to share a topic with. Default is empty.
        - `wishes`: A mapping of topic names to scores. The higher the score, the more that persons wishes to be on that topic. The scores will be rebalanced so that everyone has a 1000 points total.
    - `constraints`: Global constraints on the schedule.
        - `simultaneous`: An array of simultaneity constraints.
            - `topics`: An array of topics. Those topics must all be scheduled on the same slot, or not at all.
        - `exclusive`: An array of exclusivity constraints.
            - `topics`: An array of topics. A person can only be scheduled on one of these topics.

You can generate an input file with old default values with:
```
java -jar target/scala-2.12/gaston-assembly-0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar --generate-input
```


### Example

gaston = {

  settings.default-max-topics-per-slot = 3

  slots = [
    [
      {
        "name": "D1-afternoon",

    ]
  ]

  persons = [
    {
      absences = ["D1-afternoon"]
      name = "Anatole"
      weight = 1.0
      mandatory = ["Gamma"]
      forbidden = ["Alpha"]
      wishes = {
        "Beta" = 10
        "Gamma" = 10
        "Delta" = 10
      }
    }
    {
      incompatible = ["Anatole", "Colin"]
      name = "Bernadette"
      weight = 1.0
      mandatory = ["Alpha"]
      wishes = {

      }
    }
    {
      absences = ["D1-afternoon", "D1-evening"]
      name = "Colin"
      weight = 1.5
      mandatory = ["Beta"]
      wishes = {
        "Alpha" = 1
        "Delta" = 10
      }
    }
    {
      name = "Dominique"
      weight = 1.5
      mandatory = ["Beta"]
      wishes = {
        "Alpha" = 1
        "Delta" = 10
      }
    }
    {
      name = "Eric"

    {
      name = "Harley"
    }
  ]

  topics = [

      max = 5
      name = "Alpha"
    }
    {
      max = 4
      min = 4

    ]
  }
}
```



## Importing a table

Quite often, the wishes of the participant will be expressed in a double-entry table. The importing feature can transform this table into a HOCON file.

The table must have the topics in lines, and each person in a column (this may become selectable in the future). To import a table:
```
java -jar target/scala-2.12/gaston-assembly-0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar --from params.conf --from-table table.txt --generate-input
```

The configuration file will hold the information necessary to properly import the table, as well as basic information not present in the tables (settings and slots).

Note that you can use directly the table to generate schedules (by omitting the `--generate-input` option) but this is not recommended. You should generate the input, check it (and possibly modifiy it), then generate schedules using the input.

The parameters for the import are in the `tableSettings` section of the input file. All indexes start at 0 (first line is index 0, second line is index 1, and so on).
- `separator`: Separator between columns on a single line (should be inside quotation marks). Default value is `\t` (tabulation). 
- `persons-row`: Row for the persons' names. Default value is `0` (first row).
- `wishes-start-row`: First row of wishes, typically one because there's the persons' line before. Default value is `1` (wishes start on the second line).
- `persons-start-col`: First column containing a person. Default value is `4`.
- `topic-col`: Column for the topics' names. Default value is `0`. 
- `topic-occurrences-col`: Column for the topics' occurrences (see field `gaston.topics.occurrences`). Default value is empty, all occurrences being let at their default value of `1`. 
- `mandatory-person-col`: Column for a mandatory person on a topic (see field `gaston.persons.mandatory`, there is often only one person per topic). It is not possible to set multiple mandatory persons on a topic in the table, this is something you will have to do by modifying the input file afterwards. Default value is `1`. 
- `min-persons-col`: Column for the min number of persons on a topic (see field `gaston.topics.min`). Default value is empty (topics won't have a specific min). 
- `max-persons-col`: Column for the max number of persons on a topic (see field `gaston.topics.max`). Default value is empty (topics won't have a specific max). 
- `persons-count-add`: A number to add to the min and max number of persons read, because sometimes the mandatory person isn't counted in the table. Default value is `0`. 
- `mandatory-person-weight`: A special weight for a person if it is mandatory on at least one topic (see field `gaston.persons.weight`). Default value is `1`, i.e. same as everyone else. 
- `forbidden-person-marker`: This value in a wish cell indicates that that person is forbidden on that topic (see field `gaston.persons.forbidden`). Default value is `0`.
- `preferences-score-mapping`: An object mapping for each possible text in a wish cell, the associated score. Unknown texts are ignored. Optional, if the field is missing (or set to `null`), the text in the cell will be converted as the number and used (if the text is not a number, it is ignored).

# Developer's corner

## Brain dump

The Engine produces a lazy list of schedules, each new schedule being better than the next one. The list ends when no
further improvement can be found, which never happens on real-world examples. It starts with a seed for all random
operations.

The Engine is CPU-bound and monothreaded. Typically, you would run multiple Engines in parallel, one per CPU, with
different seeds.

An Engine run (in `Engine.lazySeq`) starts with an initial schedule respecting all constraints, but with probably a terrible score.
- If using backtracking, a schedule with topics and such will be generated. If there are enough topics to occupy everyone and not too many constraints, that is the recommended solution.
    - This uses the ScheduleGenerator, which is only used for this.
    - This schedule has been assignment-optimized (see below).
- If not using backtracking (backtrack-initial-schedule option is set to false), we start with an empty schedule. This is recommended if you expect some persons to be unassigned on some slots.
    - This starts using `Schedule.startingUnassignedOrForced`.

TODO: Document why backtracking is actually useful. Seems like always starting from an empty schedule would be easier. Maybe it's faster?

Then, the Engine calls an improver on this initial schedule. The improver will generate the lazy-list of improving schedules.
There are two improvers implemented, GreedySlotImprover and TabuSearchSlotImprover. Only the first one is currently being used.

Some vocabulary:
- Planning is when we decide which topic is on which slot. It does NOT include assigning persons to those topics or checking score. It does however require we check that mandatory persons are availabe.
  - Therefore, a planning is a schedule with no one assigned apart from the mandatory persons.
- Assignment is when we assign persons to an existing planning.
- Scheduling is doing both.

Then, the lazy-list starts being generated. A generation step starts from the latest generated schedule, and procedes with the following steps:
- Figure out all neighbours of the latest schedule in the planning spaces. Neighbours are plannings that we can get from that schedule by adding or dropping a topic, or swapping two topics.
- Eliminate neighbours that would be just a revert of the previous change (e.g. latest schedule was obtained by adding topic A, then dropping topic A is not a neighbour we need to consider).
- For each neighbour (lazily)
  - Fills in the planning by assigning people to topics. We are respecting constraints (a person can't be on two topics in the same slot), but ignoring preferences (even strong ones).
  - Improves the assignment as much as possible by swapping or moving persons around, stop when all moves make it worse.
- As soon as we find a schedule that's better than the latest schedule, we stop iterating over neighbours and output that schedule.
